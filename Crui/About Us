 After working for some time in one of the major cruise liner companies,
 we realised there weren't any black owned businesses in the ocean liner 
 industry, so we decided to build and establish a black owned company.
 					 <br />
					 		 <br />
 We began small with a company called Thathanic Vacations which we established in the year 2003, founded by 
 Sir Coconut Dlamini and Sir Kwesta Thusi. In year 2007 a partnership to expand the business  
 was formed with a new CEO Sir Ma-Inch Mzobe.
 Sir Mzobe is the CEO and has been ever since he joined the company.
	<br />
		<br />

 In 2010 we decided to join bussiness with another two striving business owners Mr Lesly Mabaso & Mr Skara Sibisi who 
 owned a company called MnR Cruises, then our company name changed to <em>Suling Cruises Vacations.</em>
				<br />
 						<br />
 Suling cruises is one of the thriving companies established a few years ago. It offer one of the best services and great deals 
 with incentives (rewards). Up to date, the company is still existing and it's one of the top and well trusted companies
 when it comes to cruise vacations.
